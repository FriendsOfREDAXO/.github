## What‚Äôs it about?

__Friends Of REDAXO__ is an initiative by and for developers who strive for open and collaborative collaboration. __FOR__ code is always released under the MIT license. Projects are coordinated and worked on by all interested FOR members. Those who have started a project remain particularly responsible. If they do not want to participate any more, the project will be caught and further developed by other FOR members.

The work of Friends Of REDAXO can be seen as a donation to the REDAXO community.
